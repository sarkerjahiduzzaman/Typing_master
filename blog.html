        <h2>Question: Difference between local storage and session storage ?</h2> 
        <h5>Answer published, Sep 15 , 2022</h5> 
        <p>The read-only sessionStorage property accesses a session Storage object for the current origin. sessionStorage is 
        similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is 
        cleared when the page session ends. 
        <br> 
        The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions. 
        localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while localStorage data has no expiration time, sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends. 
        <br> 
        When we added any key and value its parmanent for local storage on the other hand 
        in the sessionStorage its transitory.
