        <h2>Question: Difference between local storage and session storage ?</h2> 
        <h5>Answer published, Sep 15 , 2022</h5> 
        <p>The read-only sessionStorage property accesses a session Storage object for the current origin. sessionStorage is 
        similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is 
        cleared when the page session ends. 
        <br> 
        The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions. 
        localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while localStorage data has no expiration time, sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends. 
        <br> 
        When we added any key and value its parmanent for local storage on the other hand 
        in the sessionStorage its transitory.

            <h2>Question : Differences Between Global Scope and Block Scope In JavaScript ?</h2> 
<h5>Answer published, Sep 15 , 2022</h5> 

<p> Mainly Global scope means A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks. 
<br> 
And Block Scope means So far, we have seen variables defined with the var keyword. Var can declare a variable either in the global or local scope. The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined. 
<br> 
The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the same scope.ES6 introduced block scope by using the let and const keywords. 
<br> 
Block scope mainly limited in the function and some conditional statement such as if, else, function here also we seen the block scope . And global scope mainly saraunding over the script file . because its global .
